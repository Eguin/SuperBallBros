A small game made for the wii


Thanks for trying out my game!
The game supports up to 4 players and uses gamecube controllers.

I can add support for wii controllers and more players if it's requested.

To play the game on original hardware please make sure homebrew your wii.
Then drag the apps folder onto your sd card (if an apps folder already exists just merge the contents of both onto the sd card).

To play on Dolphin emulator go to Config -> Audio and change the audio from DSP HLE to either DSP LLE Recompiler or DSP LLE Interpreter.
Then select the file from the "For Dolphin Emulator" to play.
I have tested and can say it works on Dolphin emulator though I haven't tried it on any other emulator, so results may vary.


How to play:
In the opening screen players can use the A button to ready up, when all players are ready press START to begin the game.
Each player is one of the circles on the screen. Guns will spawn around the course.
Use the Joystick to move around, the A button to pick up guns, the C-Stick to aim, and R to shoot.
The goal is to try to knock the opponents off the stage by shooting them.
The more you get shot the more knockback you'll take.
When only 1 player is left that player will be dispalyed on the win screen. Press START to return the opening screen.
Enjoy!
